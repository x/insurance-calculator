# Insurance Calculator

This is a simple calculator for coming up with the total cost of your healthcare
over the span of a year given your insurance plan and recurring claims.

I built this calculator to help me select an insurance plan after starting
high-frequency (weekly) but low-ish cost (therapy sessions) claims which caused
a significant change in my health care spending.

**I know nothing about insurance. This calculator is based on what I've read on
*the internet. If I seem to have gotten something wrong, please open a ticket or
submit a PR.**
